# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this anaylsis is to create a deep neural network to classify whether the donations that were given to this charity is being used appropriately. Afterward, we try to optimize the whole model by first increasing neurons, then adding a hidden layer and finally icreasing the epochs.

## Results

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

The Is Succesful column which shows whether the money that were donated was put in use in an efficient manner is our target in this specific model.

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

The features were any column except our Is Succesful column.

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
